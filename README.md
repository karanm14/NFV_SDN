Review Paper titled "Network Virtualization and its Security Loopholes". 
Keywords: NFV, SDN, Network Virtualization, Security Loopholes of Network Virtualization


Abstract- in today's world of connectivity either it is absolute security or absolute accessibility but with the present communication model of Internet finally we have reached equilibrium. The Internet is certainly well performing but one of the biggest problems it is now facing is that we have been modifying it across the periphery, not the pith and this lack of change in the system has some serious implications; one of the possible solutions is network virtualization which also copes up with the ongoing trend of green computing. Network Virtualization has a lot of benefits as it allows, to create a test bed for future internet, a stack where we can load multiple protocols, device mobility, manageability and scalability of network but all these things have a price attached with them. By virtualizing the network we create more vulnerable areas where our security is compromised. Here we discuss what network virtualization is at the same time differentiating it with NFV and SDN, the general structure of a virtualized network and security loopholes in it and how these vulnerabilities affect different user levels who are attached with it. 

This paper was presented by me (Karan Maheshwari) at World Summit of Advances in Science, Engineering and Technology at University of Cambridge during my studentship at Vellore Institute of Technology, India on January 4 2018 at Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge, U.K.  [Certificate/acceptance letter attached for reference]
